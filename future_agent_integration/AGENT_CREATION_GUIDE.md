```
> Include data ingestion pipeline?
👉 Choose: Yes (y)
```

### Step 4: Datastore Selection
```
> Type of datastore:
👉 Choose: vertex_ai_search (recommended for BD data)
```

### Step 5: Session Storage
```
> Session storage type:
👉 Choose: in_memory (simple start) or alloydb (production)
```

### Step 6: Regional Configuration
```
> GCP region:
👉 Choose: us-central1 (default) or your preferred region
```

## 🔧 After Agent Creation

Once the agent is created, you'll have a new directory `bd-analytics-agent/` with:

```
bd-analytics-agent/
├── src/                    # Agent source code
├── terraform/              # Infrastructure as code
├── frontend/              # Optional web interface
├── data_pipeline/         # Data ingestion setup
├── .env.example          # Environment configuration
└── README.md             # Agent-specific documentation
```

## 🎯 Integration with Your Existing System

### 1. Copy Your BD Data
```bash
# Copy your prepared knowledge base
cp agent_knowledge_base.json bd-analytics-agent/data/
cp bd_agent_config.json bd-analytics-agent/
cp bd_agent_prompts.json bd-analytics-agent/
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cd bd-analytics-agent
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your settings:
# - Google Cloud Project ID
# - Service account key path
# - Vertex AI configuration
```

### 3. Connect to Your Local Database
```python
# In bd-analytics-agent/src/agent.py
# Add integration with your existing local_database_manager

from your_project.core.local_database_manager import get_local_db_manager

class BDAnalyticsAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_manager = None
        
    async def initialize(self):
        self.db_manager = await get_local_db_manager()
        
    async def query_contacts(self, query: str):
        """Query contacts using AI with access to your local data"""
        contacts = await self.db_manager.search_contacts()
        # Use RAG to provide intelligent responses
        return self.rag_query(query, contacts)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Development
```bash
cd bd-analytics-agent
python -m src.main  # Start locally for testing
```

### Option 2: Cloud Run Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Google Cloud Run
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Option 3: Agent Engine Deployment
```bash
# Deploy using Vertex AI Agent Engine
gcloud ai agents deploy
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Agent

### Sample Queries to Test:
```
1. "Who are my hottest leads this week?"
2. "What opportunities were discussed with [Company Name]?"
3. "Which contacts need immediate follow-up?"
4. "Generate a quarterly BD summary"
5. "Show me high-value prospects in the technology sector"
```

### Expected Capabilities:
✅ **Contact Intelligence**: AI-powered contact analysis and lead scoring
✅ **Interaction Analysis**: Sentiment analysis and opportunity identification  
✅ **Follow-up Recommendations**: Smart suggestions based on interaction history
✅ **Executive Reporting**: Automated BD summaries and pipeline analysis
✅ **Semantic Search**: Natural language queries across your BD data

## 📊 Integration Architecture

## 🔐 Security & Access

1. **Service Account**: Use the new service account you're creating
2. **Data Privacy**: Your BD data stays in your control
3. **Access Control**: Configure IAM roles for team access
4. **Audit Logging**: Built-in logging for all agent interactions

## 🎉 Next Steps After Creation

1. **Test Locally**: Verify agent works with your BD data
2. **Deploy to Cloud**: Use Terraform for production deployment
3. **Integrate Workflows**: Connect to your existing BD processes
4. **Train Team**: Show team how to interact with the AI agent
5. **Monitor & Optimize**: Use built-in observability tools

## 🔗 Key Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Production-Ready**: Built-in monitoring, scaling, and observability
✅ **AI-Enhanced**: Advanced capabilities beyond your current system
✅ **Scalable**: Handles growing data and team size
✅ **Integrated**: Works with your existing Google Sheets workflow
✅ **Secure**: Enterprise-grade security and access controls
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-use Cloud Run pricing

**🚨 Important**: After the agent creation completes, you'll need to:
1. Set up your new Google service account
2. Configure the environment variables
3. Deploy and test the agent

This transforms your BD analytics from a local tool into a production-ready AI agent platform! 🚀
